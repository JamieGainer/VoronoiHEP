# VoronoiHEP
Tools for using geometric properties of Voronoi Tessellations in High Energy Physics.  Built on scipy.

## Currently Inactive, Will Return

Ultimatelly this will contain a public version of the toolkit 
for studying Voronoi tessellations in High Energy Physics that
me and my collaborators used in arXiv:1506.04141, arXiv:1606.02721, 
and arXiv:1611.04487.
